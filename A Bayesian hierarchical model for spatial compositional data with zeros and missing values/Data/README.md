*simulated_tree.xlsx* contains the simulated tree species proportions from the spatial grid. This is produced using the `simulate_data.R` file.

The `trees_count.R` converts the proportions into conceptual counts in order to be used within the method. The conceptual counts are given in *tree_counts_1000.rds* file.
